    <h2>What is ThreeDimensions?</h2>
        <p>ThreeDimensions is a political compass test that adds a third axis to the Political Compass. The three axis model is based off SapplyValues. Questions are a mix of those from the original Political Compass and some originals I think will be good at reaching new nuances on each axis. The Retrogressive vs. Progressive axis has all new questions. </br></br>
        There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>
    <h2>Why the changes in the axes?</h2>
    <p> When most people make a third axis to the Political Compass, they create a conservative vs. progressive axis to put social issues on. However, I don't think this succeeds at being a true third axis. You don't see many lib left conservatives, as social liberalism and libertarianism tend to go hand in hand for the most part. Progressive in this case is based on the original usage of the term, and is contrasted with retrogressive. This axis is not a focus on social issues. It's possible to be a social liberal, i.e. you believe in LGBTQ+ rights, but also retrogressive, as in you believe in returning to an earlier form of community organisation. However, with that, social issues aren't just ignored, and are split between the other two axes, depending on if they involve state power or not. The original Left vs. Right has been expanded into an Egalitarian vs. Aristocratic axis. This includes economic issues, but also social issues pertaining to equality between different groups.  </br></br>
